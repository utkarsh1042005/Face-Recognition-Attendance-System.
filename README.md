# Face Recognition Attendance System 🎯  

## 📌 Overview  
This is an AI-powered **Face Recognition Attendance System** using **OpenCV and Python**.  
It automatically marks attendance by recognizing faces in real-time and logs data into a **CSV file** with date & time.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Real-time face recognition using OpenCV  
✅ Automatic attendance marking with date & time  
✅ Prevents duplicate entries for the same person on the same day  
✅ Optimized face encoding for faster processing  
✅ Converts project into an `.exe` file for easy deployment  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)  
- **face_recognition** (for face detection)  
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data handling)  
- **OpenPyXL** (for Excel automation)
