Create a faces/ Folder and Add Images
This folder will store images of registered users.

Create a new folder named faces/ in your project directory.

Add images (JPG, PNG) of different people in this folder.

Name the images as the person's name (e.g., Utkarsh.jpg, JohnDoe.png).

Ensure the main.py script loads images from this folder.

Code to Read Faces from the faces/ Folder
Modify your main.py to automatically load images from the faces/ folder:

python
Copy
Edit
import os
import cv2
import numpy as np
import face_recognition

# Path to the faces dataset folder
faces_path = "faces/"
known_face_encodings = []
known_face_names = []

# Load all images from the faces folder
for filename in os.listdir(faces_path):
    if filename.endswith(".jpg") or filename.endswith(".png"):
        img = face_recognition.load_image_file(f"{faces_path}/{filename}")
        encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(img)

        if encoding:  # Ensure at least one face is detected
            known_face_encodings.append(encoding[0])
            known_face_names.append(os.path.splitext(filename)[0])  # Remove file extension

print("âœ… Encoding Complete!")
Now, just add more images to the faces/ folder, and your program will automatically detect and encode them!
